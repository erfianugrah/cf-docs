## What is Magic WAN?

- In short, using Cloudflare as an extension of your private network (even for public applications in the future) with the variety of on-ramps and off-ramps.

- Think of connecting offices, remote users, data centers etc.

## Why?

- You get to leverage Cloudflare's network
  - This means points of presence across the globe
  - Single pane view and interconnects (think secure web gateway, DNS rules, network rules etc.)
  - You can programmatically manage your infrastructure (even more so in the future when we talk about cloud connectivity)


## How does it work?
